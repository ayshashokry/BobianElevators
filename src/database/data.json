    "content": "As the worldâ€™s smallest home lift, the Vacuum Elevator has swiftly found its place as the ultimate space-saving solution for any home. If you require a home lift but are space restricted, this Single-Passenger Home Elevator is the ideal solution for you.Our Vacuum Elevator is the smallest home lift in the world, yet it is just as capable as other residential lifts that are larger and more expensive. Our Vacuum elevator has a 350lb (159kg) lifting capability and the capacity of rising to 50 ft. (15m), over as many as five stops. With a 30 inch external diameter, it is small enough to fit in even the modest-sized house. If you thought a home lift was out of reach for you because of size constraints, this is the solution you have been looking for.",

The various characteristics of this XL home lift make it an excellent option if you want something roomier than the single passenger, but do not have enough room or the need for the wheelchair-accessible. It measures 32 inches wide on the interior diameter and 37 inches in outside of the cabin. This air-driven residential lift can safely transport two adults, or 450 lbs, up to 50 feet with an average of five stops. For an even more luxurious ride, you can opt to have a cabin seat fitted for a single rider to sit while being taken up to a different floor. ",

Even our biggest elevator takes up less space in your house than other regular lifts. Like all other vacuum elevators, the XXL does not require a separate area for machinery or extra room over and under the elevator for a pit. Since the system has a self-supporting structure, you will not have to add a frame to your house before fixing it. This means you can fit this elevator anyplace in your home!",
